More Collections for Swift
=============

More Collections for Swift introduces a few useful collections that are not currently in Swift. These collections are designed to coexist with the Swift framework.

As a general rule, the API follow Swift's Array and Dictionary API while strongly influence by [Google's Guava collection](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/GuavaExplained).   More Collections for Swift are designed to be as simple as possible while still satisfying a majority of each collectionâ€™s use cases.

## Collections

### Set
A collection that contains no duplicate elements.  More formally, contain no pair of elements e1 and e2 such that e1 == e2.  

### Tree
A collection that models a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children, represented as a set of linked nodes.

### MultiMap
A collection that maps keys to values, similar to Map, but in which each key may be associated with multiple values.

## Version

0.1 Alpha.  The API is subject to change.   

If any of these collections exist already in Swift's standard library let me know and I will delete the duplicate classes found here

## Collaborate

All development happens on GitHub.  File a bug or pull request for new features and fixes.  

## In Progress
