More Collections for Swift
=============

More Collections for Swift introduces new collection types that are not currenty in Swift, but that I've found generally useful in other languages & frameworks. These collections are designed to coexist in the existing Swift framework.

As a general rule, the API follow Swifts Array and Dictionary API while strongly influnce by [Googles' Guava collection](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/GuavaExplained).   The collections are designed to be as simple as possible while still satisfying ~90% of common usecases.

## Version

0.1 Alpha.  The API is subject to change.   

If any of these collections exist already in Swift's standard lib let me know and I will delete the duplicate classes found here
